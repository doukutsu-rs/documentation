## Cave Story+ - 2011 PC release

This section covers acquiring the data files for the original 2011 PC release of Cave Story+, often referred to simply as "Cave Story+". This version was released on various digital storefronts. doukutsu-rs is designed to be a drop-in replacement for this version, requiring no modifications to your existing game files.

Here's a breakdown of the supported versions and where to get them:

**Recommended Version: Steam**

* **Link:** [https://store.steampowered.com/app/200900/Cave\_Story/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/200900/Cave_Story/)
* **Why it's recommended:** The Steam version is generally the most well-maintained and feature-complete version of the 2011 PC release. It includes extras like achievements and cloud saves (though note that Steam Achievements are _not_ directly supported by doukutsu-rs). If you're buying Cave Story+ for the first time, this is the version we recommend.

**Epic Games Store and Humble Bundle**

* **Epic Games Store Link:** [https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cave-story-plus](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/cave-story-plus)
* **Humble Bundle Link:** [https://www.humblebundle.com/store/cave-story](https://www.humblebundle.com/store/cave-story)
* **Notes:** These versions are largely identical to the Steam release in terms of data files and the core executable. They lack the Steam-specific features like leaderboards and achievements. If you happened to get Cave Story+ for free during one of the Epic Games Store giveaways, you're good to go!

**GOG Version -&#x20;**_**Not Recommended**_

* **GOG Link:** [https://www.gog.com/en/game/cave\_story](https://www.gog.com/en/game/cave_story)
* **Important Warning:** We strongly advise _against_ purchasing the GOG version of Cave Story+. This version suffers from a number of significant technical issues due to a poorly executed port. These problems include:
  * **Incorrect Frame Timing:** The game may run much too fast or too slow, making it difficult or impossible to play correctly.
  * **Broken Organya Music:** The in-game music (Organya) playback is flawed, with tracks restarting instead of resuming, and generally sounding incorrect.
  * **Missing Cutscenes:** Some cutscenes, like the falling island sequence, freeze the game for a couple of seconds.
  * **Broken pausing:** Pausing the game can cause glitches.
  * Various other small issues, such as incorrect text colors, are also present.

The GOG version adds no value over the Steam, Epic Games Store, or Humble Bundle versions, and introduces numerous game-breaking bugs. It is, frankly, a waste of money. While doukutsu-rs can mitigate _some_ of these issues, the underlying problems with the GOG release remain. We strongly recommend obtaining Cave Story+ from a different source.
